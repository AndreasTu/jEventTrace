# jEventTrace

Event Tracer for JVM Applications

The event trace will write
the [Trace Event Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview#).

This can be viewed by a Chrominum or Chrome browser with the page `about:tracing` or by
using [Calapult](https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/tree/master/tracing).

## Caveats

This is a very early stage project. It is currently only a proof of concept.

## Runtime

The project requires at least Java 17 to build and run. Also, the project using the `jEventTrace` library requires at
least Java 17.


## Usage

You can use jEventTrace via [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/#AndreasTu/jEventTrace).
